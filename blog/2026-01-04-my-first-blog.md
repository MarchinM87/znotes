ZNotes is not a blog in the traditional sense.

It is a continuously evolving engineering notebook that documents how real C++ and Unreal Engine systems are designed, structured, and maintained.

The content focuses on reusable code frameworks, engine-level patterns, architectural trade-offs, and practical solutions encountered in production-oriented projects.

Most notes originate from real development scenarios rather than tutorials, and are written with long-term maintainability and clarity in mind.

If you are looking for quick fixes or copy-paste snippets, this site may not be for you.

If you care about why a system is built in a certain way, how components interact, and where the boundaries should be drawn, you will likely find these notes useful.
